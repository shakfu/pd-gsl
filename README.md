# puredata scientific library (psl)

Wraps some [gsl](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) functions for puredata.


## To build


```
make
```

Note that the the static libraries included in this project are currently macos only. This is
a development conveniance during the early stage of this project. To make it work with other platforms just use the platform specific static libs instead.

## TODO

- [ ] [list f1 f2] causes crashes. Should test for 'list' in argv!
