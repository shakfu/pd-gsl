# puredata scientific library (psl)

Wraps some [gsl](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) functions for puredata.



## To build

The static libraries which are included in this project are macos only. This is
just because it's very early stage and I want to keep it simple while fleshing
out the api.

```
make
```

Note: To make it work with other platforms just use the platform specific static libs instead.
